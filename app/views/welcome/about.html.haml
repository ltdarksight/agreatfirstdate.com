%h1 About us

%p aGreatFirstDate.com, Ltd. was founded in Denver, Colorado in late 2011.  We have a simple mission: get people on better dates.  What does that mean exactly?  Great dates happen when you are out with someone who is attractive, and with whom you have something to talk about.  The site was designed to bring out those two qualities in each and every member.  

%p
  We're a small startup, intent on focusing entirely on great user experiences and putting the customer first.  We accomplish those goals by using the latest technology and talking to our customers every chance we get.  If you are interested in joining our team and helping us build great dates, send us an e-mail:
